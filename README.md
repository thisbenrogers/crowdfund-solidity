# Solidity/React application #


This application is based on the guided project in Stephen Grider's *Ethereum and Solidity, the Complete Developer's Guide* found on Udemy. 

This was an excellent introduction to Solidity and Ethereum in general, and I'm looking forward to studying the Solidity docs to explore how the langauge has changed since Grider recorded this course in 2018.
